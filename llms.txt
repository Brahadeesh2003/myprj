[faq]

Q: What is Computer System Validation (CSV)?  
A: CSV is the documented process of ensuring computerized systems in regulated industries perform as intended and comply with standards.  

Q: Why is CSV important in pharma and biotech?  
A: It ensures patient safety, product quality, and compliance with FDA, EMA, and other regulators.  

Q: What is the difference between CSV and CSA?  
A: CSV emphasizes documentation-heavy validation; CSA focuses on risk-based testing and critical thinking.  

Q: What is GAMP 5 and how does GoVal support it?  
A: GAMP 5 is ISPE’s risk-based validation framework. GoVal includes a GxP assessment engine with GAMP category mapping.  

Q: How does GoVal support FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance?  
A: GoVal provides electronic signatures, secure workflows, and audit trails for trustworthy records.  

Q: What is EU Annex 11?  
A: Annex 11 sets requirements for computerized systems in GMP-regulated processes. GoVal ensures compliance via audit trails and system controls.  

Q: What is ALCOA+ in data integrity?  
A: ALCOA+ = Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available. GoVal enforces these principles.  

Q: What are the main documents in CSV?  
A: Validation Plan, URS, FS, DS, IQ, OQ, PQ, Traceability Matrix, Test Reports, and Validation Summary Report. GoVal digitizes these.  

Q: What is a User Requirement Specification (URS)?  
A: URS describes what the system should do. GoVal’s AI helps draft and trace URS efficiently.  

Q: What is a Traceability Matrix?  
A: It maps requirements to test cases. GoVal auto-generates RTMs linking requirements, risks, and test results.  

Q: What are IQ, OQ, PQ?  
A: Installation, Operational, and Performance Qualification. GoVal provides structured digital workflows for each.  

Q: What is periodic review in CSV?  
A: A periodic check to ensure systems remain validated. GoVal automates reminders and documentation.  

Q: What is risk-based validation?  
A: It focuses validation on functions impacting safety and quality. GoVal prioritizes testing using a built-in risk engine.  

Q: How does GoVal support CSA?  
A: GoVal aligns with FDA’s CSA approach, enabling risk-based testing over excessive documentation.  

Q: How do you validate SaaS or cloud systems?  
A: By reviewing vendor documents, risks, and critical functions. GoVal provides templates and workflows for SaaS/cloud validation.  

Q: How to manage system upgrades and patches?  
A: Assess risk, regression test critical functions, and update documentation. GoVal automates impact assessment and change control.  

Q: When is revalidation required?  
A: After significant changes or identified risks. GoVal automates revalidation triggers.  

Q: How does GoVal validate AI/ML systems?  
A: By enforcing data integrity, reproducibility, and model accuracy. GoVal provides traceability for AI/ML datasets and test results.  

Q: Can GoVal integrate with automated testing tools?  
A: Yes. GoVal connects with testing frameworks while maintaining compliance.  

Q: How does GoVal help in regulatory audits?  
A: GoVal centralizes evidence, ensures traceability, and generates audit-ready reports.  

Q: What are common CSV audit findings?  
A: Missing traceability, incomplete testing, and poor risk assessments. GoVal mitigates these with automation.  

Q: How does GoVal compare to manual validation?  
A: GoVal reduces cycle times, eliminates paper, lowers compliance costs, and improves audit readiness.  

Q: How does GoVal differentiate from competitors?  
A: Unlike ValGenesis (object-centric) and Kneat (document-centric), GoVal combines AI assistance, CSA alignment, and continuous validation in one modern platform.  

Q: What is the future of CSV?  
A: The future is CSA, automation, and continuous validation. GoVal is built to support this shift.
